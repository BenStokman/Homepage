						<h1 class="text-extra-dark-gray alt-font font-weight-600"></h1>
						<p class="text-large line-height-30 text-extra-dark-gray"><span class="first-letter first-letter-big text-deep-pink border-0">THIS</span>may not be surprising to you, or it might considering many people reading this might not know too much about me - but I do not use Facebook. I have an account, but I have not touched it since I first created it. I first created it out of curiosity when I was in my early 10s, and did not touch it because I did not have a use for it. But when I started to develop myself as a privacy advocate, my reason for not using it changed to a mix of disgust, worry, and fear. As more and more news came out about the biggest social media network in the world, my identity as a privacy advocate only became stronger and stronger.</p>
						<p class="text-large line-height-30 text-extra-dark-gray">I'm going to be very clear - I'm not going to sugar coat things or lie to you like Facebook does. This article is an unyielding passive aggressive rant about Facebook packaged in the typical informative essay this blog is meant for. My purpose is not only to show you how to educate yourself on this topic as a person who most likely knows nothing about the technological world; well, that is exactly my purpose, but I do not believe that I can adequately do that without giving you all the facts about the topic at hand, including but not limited to how trash Facebook is.</p>
						<p class="text-large line-height-30 text-extra-dark-gray">So, in order to do this, I will have to give you the complete perspective of someone who hates facebook: me. So for each of my three gripes I listed with Facebook - disgust, worry, and fear - I will explain why I have them; starting with:</p>
						<h3 class="text-deep-pink alt-font font-weight-600">Reason #1: Disgust</h3>
						<p class="text-large line-height-30 text-extra-dark-gray">Cue the groans, laugh if you want, but I hold the position that people should not share things about themselves on social media. And this is coming from someone who has relatively personal details on <a href="https://benstokman.me">my website</a>.</p>
						<p class="text-large line-height-30 text-extra-dark-gray">But I understand that anyone and everyone can view that information, so I am always careful to remove personal data such as exif data from photos that can give away my location, addresses from documents, and other private things.</p>
						<p class="text-large line-height-30 text-extra-dark-gray">But I always see people oversharing and not really minding what they put on social media. Most people that have a problem with this usually point to people using this data to harrass people in real life, or to asult them or cause harm to them in some way. But the truth is that, as people are more aware of this issue, people are generally more careful with giving away location and what they share online is attached to their real life.</p>
						<p class="text-large line-height-30 text-extra-dark-gray">The real danger is with the network itself. I can't really say what Facebook does with user content, because they like to keep any algorithms private, but it is safe to say that they do anything and everything with this data. They're not just using like history - they're most likely scanning each and every photo to find what's in it, using mouse movements to gauge precise reactions to things.</p> 
						<p class="text-large line-height-30 text-extra-dark-gray">And of course, they're tracking people around the internet - on and off Facebook. And this is where things start to get really bad. People can have things they do not want to share logged. And all of this data is downloadable, meaning anyone and everyone can just buy a huge chunk in almost anyone's life. This brings me to the next reason:</p>
						<h3 class="text-deep-pink alt-font font-weight-600">Reason #2:  Worry</h3>
						<p class="text-large line-height-30 text-extra-dark-gray">I am worried about what could happen if this data becomes easily searchable and available. As storage and internet speeds become larger, it becomes more and more feasable for someone to host this data by themselves, or to find a cheap server to do it anonymously.</p>
						<p class="text-large line-height-30 text-extra-dark-gray">Many people argue that privacy is not important because they have nothing to hide. But I do not get that statement - everyone has something to hide. Humor this: if a random person off the street asked to look through your phone, your texts, your email, browsing history, photos; would anyone, especially the people who claim they have nothing to hide, ever do that?</p>
						<p class="text-large line-height-30 text-extra-dark-gray">No, they would never. Which is why I am worried about the existence of this data. I fell so many people do not know what is in there. The imfamous SCL Group/Cambridge analytica was able to get precise political data on nearaly every us voter, and <a href="https://qz.com/1782348/cambridge-analytica-used-these-5-political-ads-to-target-voters/">send targeted ads based off of this data</a>. And this stuff gets out of personal conflict and into politics, into world peace, war, all of the most important things.</p>
						<p class="text-large line-height-30 text-extra-dark-gray">And when I realized what the data can do, I developed the third reason:</p>
						<h3 class="text-deep-pink alt-font font-weight-600">Reason #3:  Fear</h3>
						<p class="text-large line-height-30 text-extra-dark-gray">I am terrified of what Facebook can do.</p>
						<p class="text-large line-height-30 text-extra-dark-gray">Like, actually terrified. Facebook is run by a money hungry lizard man that seems to only want money. <a href="https://www.wired.co.uk/article/facebook-fine-ico-cambridge-analytica">Time after time</a>, Facebook has been caught violating the law and then apologises, and faces a slap on the wrist fine and keeps on doing the same thing with a different name.</a>
						<p class="text-large line-height-30 text-extra-dark-gray">Facebook's <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/7/27/16050446/facebook-net-neutrality-digital-colonialism-internet-org">Free "Basics"</a> service <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/jul/27/facebook-free-basics-developing-markets">has many developing countries in it's grasp</a>, and can track everything people do with it.
